Visualizing data from the Call of Duty franchise.

This is a simple project visualizing the sales, ratings, and player rentention of Call of Duty. 

I could not find a file that contains the data that I require to complete my project. I created a excel sheet that contains Title, Year of Released, Units Sold, Ratings (By system), and developer. The sales data is from www.statista.com. The ratings is from www.metacritic.com. The player count is from www.gamestat.com.

The graps are programmed in Python. The packages are seaborn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
